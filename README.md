# Mobarista

#### Goal:
My focus on this test is to display the wider knowledge i have as a professional as i can in the time invested.
I may briefly, but enoughly covered many subjects that i consider relevant for a JS professional.
Them being:
- Clean and comprehensive code
- good architecture, ability to think and organize massive projects.
- capability to operate the libraries suggested by the company

Im aware of many points of improvement or that i deliberatley skipped for the sake of focusing on different things, or that i thought the knowledge/challenge they represent where already covered.

## Installation and usage
- `npm install`
- `npx nx run mobile:start`(will start metro for the mobile app)
  - its important to ensure node-modules in the apps are linked with: `npx nx run mobile:ensure-symlink`
- `npx nx run mobile:run-android` (will launch android)

(with Nx [vscode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nrwl.angular-console) you can see all commands available)
### Architecture:

This project is a Monorepo type(integrated repo).
All dependencies are installed on the root folder, and used on packages and apps.
Its good because allow ease to implement the pattern and the following possibilities:
- apps:
  - (all standalone applications, that often get deployed. websites etc. consumers of libs, as explained below.)
- libs:
  - all that contributes to organize the multiple needs of the application ecossystem.
  - they contain for example:
  - utils/helpers (pure functions, oftem small like: convertToNumber)
  - publishable ESLint especific for the company or project.
  - Design Systems
  - Services often consumed across apps (eg: `CoffeIT.awsUploader(item)`)

### Software decisions:

| Subject | Tooling | Motivations |
|---|---|---|
| Style | `dripsy` | I never used before, but as long it has styled-component/emotion nature, offers great suport for typescript and theming. Also the `sx` prop is really cool. `chackra-ui` feelings, make easy for me to style faster. also same creator from `moti` maybe make a good combo.<br/><br/>_Disclaimer: I often dont inline style, but create styles in a separate file, but abused it this time for brevity_|
| Animation | `moti` | It is performant and offers a familiar API as framer-motion, making easy to create simpler transitions, spring animations and so. |
| ErrorHandling | `react-native-error-boundary` and `react-native-exception-handler` | One offers DOM error placeholder to side with Suspense-mode in react, and the other catches global JS and Native throws.|
| State and Network data | `react-query` and `redux` | I abandoned redux for almost 4 years now, but seems a plus for you. I reckon the benefits though i couldnt help myself of holding to react-query to handle server/api stuff. its has many benefits i cant number here.|
| Typescript and data validation | `zod` | Although i didnt used it at all, i would use Zod to declare more niche types (ex: UUID instead of string) and validate it. maybe in conjunction with stuff like react-hook-form|

### Disclaimers
My windows enviromnent was very buggy, especially running storybook scripts. so it prevented me to do alot of progress on scripting for it.
Also incapability to care for iOS.
